so I can now train the thing, and it learns something bogus like all .5.

what is the regular range of labels?
when is training supposed to stop?

apparently i still have the old mnist code in vblandr/mnist, it still runs. Which is good because i can't find where I originally got this, the current tensorflow code is different.

tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist.input_data.read_data_sets
tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.mnist import read_data_sets
