so I can now train the thing, and it learns something bogus like all .5.

what is the regular range of labels?
when is training supposed to stop?

apparently i still have the old mnist code in vblandr/mnist, it still runs. Which is good because i can't find where I originally got this, the current tensorflow code is different.

tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist.input_data.read_data_sets
tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.mnist import read_data_sets


LABELS FUCKNG BULLSHIT
ok. i want to know where my labels are set, and how to get them into one-hot encoding (#3). 
the array for labels is built in dataSet.py::make_arrays line 330
    in there, dataset_cur_genre uses int16... at somepoint should probably be storing float32(#2)

ok. so let's get started with audio stuff. 

NUMBER OF OUTPUTS
* First thing I need to figure out is out to change the number of outputs.
* main.py uses dataSet.TOTAL_INPUTS. I don't seem to have a similar variable for outputs, 
  other than ONE_HOT. i should probably make that work...? 
* i can change the number of inputs simply by changing TOTAL_INPUTS and forcing repickling.

==== WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE FUCKING TYPE OF INPUTS AND OUTPUTS???? ====
* ffmpeg returns int16, currently this data is stored as is in pickles
* right now, dataSet.make_arrays has: 
    * inputs:   np.int16 
    * outputs:  np.int32
* main.py placeholder
    * input:    tf.float32
    * output:   tf.int32 (one hot or not)
* main.py evaluation (evaluates the quality of the logits at predicting the label)
    * logit tensor: float
    * lable tensor: int32 in the range [0, dataSet.NUM_CLASSES]. So this is not expecting a one-hot encoding.

USING SMS TOOLS
* trying to use stftanal in main.py BUT
    * original call to mX, pX = STFT.stftAnal(x, fs, w, N, H) failed because the one version of the 
      stftanal function that I found only takes 4 arguments. 
    * this is even though the original fucking file howework A4part3.py uses this very fucking same 
      fucking call. Ok, well apparently xavier just deleted that call
        * https://github.com/MTG/sms-tools/commit/2adf5fd4e13ceaa882db00614b183a3ffe991118
    * so I can just ignore it, i guess. yeah, that seems to work. 
* I need to analyse one of my songs instead of this flute thing, and understand what of this to feed the network. 
* right, so in fact I need to first understand what the stft gives me, then do this before picking the data, along with 
  making sure data is floats between [0,1]  

* I think i need to use just the normal dft, because the stft is only for a short window, and I don't care about that. 
  Short windows would be useful if I was doing this live... I think. 
* Let's do the dft for the whole 10 secs


-------------------- 2016-10-27 ------------------------
ok. so coming back to this. 

TODO
* check out inputs and outputs
* use dft output instead of raw samples
