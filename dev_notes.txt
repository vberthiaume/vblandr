so I can now train the thing, and it learns something bogus like all .5.

what is the regular range of labels?
when is training supposed to stop?

apparently i still have the old mnist code in vblandr/mnist, it still runs. Which is good because i can't find where I originally got this, the current tensorflow code is different.

tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist.input_data.read_data_sets
tensorflow.contrib.learn.python.learn.datasets.mnist import read_data_sets


LABELS FUCKNG BULLSHIT
ok. i want to know where my labels are set, and how to get them into one-hot encoding (#3). 
the array for labels is built in dataSet.py::make_arrays line 330
    in there, dataset_cur_genre uses int16... at somepoint should probably be storing float32(#2)

ok. so let's get started with audio stuff. First thing I need to figure out is out to change the number of outputs.
I think main.py is pretty much independent of the number of inputs and outputs.
