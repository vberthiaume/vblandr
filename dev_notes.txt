so I can now train the thing, and it learns something bogus like all .5.

what is the regular range of labels?
when is training supposed to stop?

apparently i still have the old mnist code in vblandr/mnist, it still runs. Which is good because i can't find where I originally got this, the current tensorflow code is different.
